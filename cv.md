## Summary
  My journey into the world of Front-End Development began unexpectedly through my hobby in 3D modeling, where I dabbled in coding. This sparked my curiosity, leading me to discover the exciting field of web development. Fascinated by the idea of creating something out of nothing, I dove into learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS on my own and built my first simple website. 

  However, I soon realized the importance of mentorship and a supportive community to truly thrive. Enrolling in a structured training program, I found incredible inspiration in the potential of web development to enhance information accessibility, especially for individuals with unique needs. This realization ignites my passion to continue growing as a developer and making a positive impact through technology.
